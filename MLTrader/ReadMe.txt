It can then serve this data to other servers via https requests.Development Server runs on port 5000 and is meant for all other functions. Machine Learning, data visualization, tests, etc..If running this software for the first time, you will need to get the correct chromedriver file for your version of Google Chrome and replace the chromedriver file in Development Server > src > resources.
